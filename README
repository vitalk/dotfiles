INSTALLATION

Clone the git repos wherever your want and run the bootstrap script. It will
pull in the latest changes and copy the files to your home directory.

git clone https://github.com/vitalk/dotfiles.git && cd dotfiles && ./install.sh

Auto completion will be available for all script options after script
installation. Run '--help' for details:

# this expand to ./install.sh --help
./install.sh --h[Tab]

CUSTOMIZATION

If you need to do some custom modifications, you does not need to fork the
entire repository, just clone it to your local machine and add some local
updates to it.

The local config is a file with the name as in repo and that ends with the
suffix `.local`.  Local configs loaded after global, so you can overwrite the
original settings.  For example, to add some local modifications to `.bashrc`
create file `.bashrc.local` and put your updates here, or to add some aliases to
your config add file `.bash/aliases.local` or ever `.bash/aliases/system.local`.
All thats files will be loaded to your enviroment.

For example my `.bashrc.local` set my git user details:

```bash
git config user.name "Vital Kudzelka"
git config user.email "vital.kudzelka@gmail.com"
```
